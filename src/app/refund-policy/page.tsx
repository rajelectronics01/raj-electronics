            Cancellations will only be considered if the request is made within <strong>2 days</strong> of placing the order. However,
            cancellation requests may not be entertained if the orders have been communicated to such sellers /
            merchant(s) listed on the Platform and they have initiated the process of shipping them, or the
            product is out for delivery. In such an event, you may choose to reject the product at the doorstep.

            <strong>Raj Electronics</strong> does not accept cancellation requests for perishable items like flowers, eatables, etc.

            product delivered is not good.

          <li>
            In case of receipt of damaged or defective items, please report to our customer service team. The
